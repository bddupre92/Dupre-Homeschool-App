**Product Requirements Document (PRD): Homeschool Inspiration & Community App (MVP)**

---

## 1. Purpose & Vision  
Create a mobile‑friendly, web‑accessible platform that unifies content discovery, community support, and simple organization for U.S. homeschoolers. The MVP will let users share and save lesson ideas, follow age‑ and subject‑specific feeds, and engage with peers—addressing fragmented tools and isolation in the homeschooling journey.

---

## 2. Background & Opportunity  
- **Pain Points:** Overwhelm in curriculum research; isolation from dispersed communities; scattered use of general social apps (Facebook, Pinterest, TikTok) for inspiration.  
- **Opportunity:** Deliver a dedicated “homeschool‑only” feed + boards experience, combined with light community features, to become the go‑to hub for lesson ideas and peer support.

## 13. Assumptions & Dependencies  
- Early seed users (influencers/bloggers) will join and provide initial content.  
- ElasticSearch/Algolia integration is available without licensing delays.  
- AWS infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines are in place.

---

## 14. Risks & Mitigations  
- **Risk:** Low content volume → _Mitigation:_ Beta Creator Program to seed content.  
- **Risk:** Feature overload → _Mitigation:_ Strict MVP scope; defer advanced planning tools to Phase 2.  
- **Risk:** User churn if onboarding is poor → _Mitigation:_ Invest in clear, guided onboarding flows.

## 15. Success Criteria & Next Steps  
1. **Internal review & approval** of PRD by stakeholders.  
2. **User story prioritization** and creation of detailed acceptance criteria.  
3. **Kickoff sprint planning** for Phase 1.  
4. **Recruitment** of 20–50 beta creators for early content seeding.

With this PRD, we align product goals, user needs, and implementation roadmap—setting a clear path to deliver a compelling MVP that addresses the core challenges of the homeschooling community.
